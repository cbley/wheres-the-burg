# Where's The Burg?

Simple map to find the nearest issue of [The Burg](https://theburgnews.com/) magazine.

I created this map because The Burg is great but also mostly to play around with the [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js) and the [Mapbox Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/directions/).

The locations were geocoded from the list at https://theburgnews.com/distribution-locations. I'm still tweaking the geocoded locations and resolving any errors, but locations in Harrisburg should be correct.
